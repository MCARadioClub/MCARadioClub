        <h3>Welcome to Amateur Radio!</h3>
        <p>The intent of this page is to provide a general guide as to how to get into amateur radio. </p>
        <p>This hobby has infinite micro-niches, so do not be put off if you find somehting you do not like. This small hobby has so many things that you can do with it, that you can generally avoid things that you don't like. With that said, one of the few things that can not be avoided the the license examination. This is a requirement for all three levels of license classes (Technician, General, and Extra). While many people find test to be diffuclt and boring, the amateur radio exams are in place to make sure operators do not cause harm to themselves, others, or property.</p>
        <p>The three license classes are progressive in terms of what you are allowed to do (known as incentive licensing). As you progress, the more thorough the exams are. This goes back to safety. </p>
        <p>Now you are probably wondering...</p>

        <h3> What is amateur radio?</h3>

        <p>As previously mentioned, while this is a small hobby, there is an abundance of things you can do. The following list is by no means exclusively what you can. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simply talk to other operators</li>
            <li>Build electronic circuits (amps, radios, et. al.)</li>
            <li>Compete in contests</li>
            <li>Build larger scale things like antennas</li>
            <li>Emergency communications</li>
            <li>POTA - operate outdoors at a state or national park</li>
            <li>Digital modes where you can have a full QSO (meaning conversation) keyboard to keyboard</li>
            <li>Enjoy the comraderie of a local club</li>
            <li>And so much more, so much so it can't be listed!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now in order to do this (with the exception of the latter), you need to get licensed. In order to do so, you need to be able to answer the questions on the exam. There are many sources, but by far the most modern, beneficial, and easy to use one is <a href="https://hamstudy.org">HamStudy.org</a>.</p>
        <p>They have every single possible question you could get, and they have a comprehensive rationale as to why the correct answer is the correct answer. This is a feature no other platform has, or at least as intuitive as it is with them. </p>
        <p>However with that said, it very well may not be enough to understand it enough to pass practice exams. For a more in depth learning, there are several options. </p>
        <p>One good option is the  ARRL Ham Radio License Manual 5th Edition (ISBN: 978-1-62595-155-7) book. This has the questions, and a more textbook style portion to learn the concepts better. </p>
        <p>Also, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3DKjqB4OLY2UXm2KqDpwQ">W4EEY YouTube Series</a> is good for anyone who wants to see things more visually.</p>
        <p>Regardless of what style of learning you benefit from, you are always welcome to get in touch with us at the Madison County Amateur Radio Club (W9VCF)! You can do so via email, social media DM, or visit one of our meeting. </p>

        <p>Once you feel ready to take the exam, you have two options. Option one is to test remotely, which involve isolating youself in a room, letting the exam administrators (known as VEs) see around your enviorment, and letting them have control of your computer. The other option is to test in person, which could mean taking on paper, but some clubs are doing in-person online testing. </p>
        <p>Online testing is faster, with remote being guranteed to be online. However, many find the requiremtns for remote testing to be too extreme, and would rather do it in person. In-person testing is easier, regardless if it is online or on paper. In person testing is primarily paper testing, but check with the club to see what is available. </p>
        <p>We suggest testing in-person, that way we can touch base with you about getting involved with amateur radio.</p>
        <p>Once you have passes the test and have your call, you are free to get on the air and make contacts!</p>
